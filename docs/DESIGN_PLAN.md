# Scenario.com MCP Server Design Plan

## Overview

The Scenario.com MCP Server is designed to provide a Model Context Protocol (MCP) interface to the Scenario.com API. This allows AI assistants to generate images and remove backgrounds from images using the Scenario.com API.

## Architecture

The server is built using the FastMCP framework, which provides a simple way to create MCP servers. The server exposes tools and resources that can be used by AI assistants to interact with the Scenario.com API.

### Tools

- `generate_image`: Generate an image from a text prompt
- `remove_background`: Remove the background from an image

### Resources

- `status://info`: Get information about the server status
- `job://{job_id}`: Get information about a job
- `asset://{asset_id}`: Get information about an asset

## Implementation

The server is implemented in Python using the FastMCP framework. The server uses the Scenario.com API to generate images and remove backgrounds from images.

### Dependencies

- Python 3.8+
- FastMCP
- Requests

### Configuration

The server is configured using environment variables:

- `SCENARIO_API_KEY`: The Scenario.com API key
- `SCENARIO_API_SECRET`: The Scenario.com API secret
- `SCENARIO_MODEL_ID`: The default model ID to use for image generation
